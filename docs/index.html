            <p class="lead">A lightweight Garlicoin desktop wallet</p>

            <p>Garlium is a lightweight desktop wallet for Garlicoin, based on <a href="https://electrum.org/">Electrum</a>. By deterministically generating your wallet keys, you can save your wallet by writing a simple 12-word phrase down. You can load your wallet at any time by simply typing the 12-word phrase back in, on any computer, anywhere.</p>

            <h1>FAQ</h1>

            <dl>
                <dt>My receiving address has changed. Why is this?</dt>
                <dd>For privacy reasons, Garlium assigns you a new default receive address when the old one has been used. <b>Your old addresses will still work</b>, and you can see the entire address list by going to <kbd>View -> Show Addresses</kbd></dt>

                <dt>Do I need to keep Garlium open to receive coins?</dt>
                <dd>No. Garlium will automatically reconnect to the network and catch up with transaction history when you open it. Shutting it down is safe, even for extended periods of time.</dd>

                <dt>Is my wallet stored on an external server?</dt>
                <dd>No. Garlium uses server nodes to ensure a fast synchronization, but your actual wallet and private key is only stored on your computer, and is <u>never</u> sent to the internet.</dd>

                <dt>How do I import a paper wallet into Garlium?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a new wallet. You can do this from the setup wizard, or go to <kbd>File -> New/Restore</kbd>.</li>
                        <li>When asked which kind of wallet to create, select "Import Garlicoin addresses or private keys".</li>
                        <li>
                            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                                <li>To create a watching-only wallet, paste in the <b>address</b> of your paper wallet.</li>
                                <li>To create a full wallet, paste in the <b>private key</b> of your paper wallet.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <dt>What's the difference between a watching-only wallet and a full wallet?</dt>
                    <dd>A watching-only wallet only stores your wallet's public key - its address. This means that you cannot spend the coins in the wallet, merely look at them. This is a lot more secure, because even if your computer gets compromised, an attacker will not gain access to your coins. On the other hand, a full wallet stores your address's private key as well. This allows you to send your coins, but is less secure.</dd>
                </dd>

                <dt>How do I import a CLI (garlicoind/garlicoin-cli) wallet into Garlium?</dd>
                <dd>Run the command <code>garlicoin-cli dumpprivkey &lt;YOURADDRESS&gt;</code>. This will provide you with your address's private key. See above (regarding paper wallets) for instructions on how to import that private key into Garlium.</dt>

                <dt>How do I import a breadbox.xyz wallet into Garlium?</dt>
                <dd>Because Breadbox doesn't allow you to export your private key, that is not possible. You must transfer your coins directly to your Garlium receive address.</dd>

                <dt>Garlium is being detected as a virus!</dt>
                <dd>Relax. Garlium is completely safe. Something causes some major AVs to flag Garlium as a trojan, for unknown reasons.</dt>

            <h2>Nodes</h2>
            <p>If you're having connection issues, perhaps connect to another server node. You can add a node by going to <kbd>Tools -> Network -> Servers</kbd>, unchecking "Select server automatically", and inserting the details in the two text boxes.</p>
