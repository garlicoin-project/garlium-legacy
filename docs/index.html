            <p class="lead">A lightweight Garlicoin desktop wallet</p>

            <p>Garlium is a lightweight desktop wallet for Garlicoin, based on <a href="https://electrum.org/">Electrum</a>. By deterministically generating your wallet keys, you can save your wallet by writing a simple 12-word phrase down. You can load your wallet at any time by simply typing the 12-word phrase back in, on any computer, anywhere.</p>

            <h1>FAQ</h1>

            <dl>
                <dt>My receiving address has changed. Why is this?</dt>
                <dd>For privacy reasons, Garlium assigns you a new default receive address when the old one has been used. <b>Your old addresses will still work</b>, and you can see the entire address list by going to <kbd>View -> Show Addresses</kbd></dt>

                <dt>Do I need to keep Garlium open to receive coins?</dt>
                <dd>No. Garlium will automatically reconnect to the network and catch up with transaction history when you open it. Shutting it down is safe, even for extended periods of time.</dd>

                <dt>Is my wallet stored on an external server?</dt>
                <dd>No. Garlium uses server nodes to ensure a fast synchronization, but your actual wallet and private key is only stored on your computer, and is <u>never</u> sent to the internet.</dd>

                <dt>How do I import a paper wallet into Garlium?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a new wallet. You can do this from the setup wizard, or go to <kbd>File -> New/Restore</kbd>.</li>
                        <li>When asked which kind of wallet to create, select "Import Garlicoin addresses or private keys".</li>
                        <li>
                            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                                <li>To create a watching-only wallet, paste in the <b>address</b> of your paper wallet.</li>
                                <li>To create a full wallet, paste in the <b>private key</b> of your paper wallet.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <dt>What's the difference between a watching-only wallet and a full wallet?</dt>
                    <dd>A watching-only wallet only stores your wallet's public key - its address. This means that you cannot spend the coins in the wallet, merely look at them. This is a lot more secure, because even if your computer gets compromised, an attacker will not gain access to your coins. On the other hand, a full wallet stores your address's private key as well. This allows you to send your coins, but is less secure.</dd>
                </dd>

                <dt>How do I import a CLI (garlicoind/garlicoin-cli) wallet into Garlium?</dd>
                <dd>Run the command <code>garlicoin-cli dumpprivkey &lt;YOURADDRESS&gt;</code>. This will provide you with your address's private key. See above (regarding paper wallets) for instructions on how to import that private key into Garlium.</dt>

                <dt>How do I import a breadbox.xyz wallet into Garlium?</dt>
                <dd>Because Breadbox doesn't allow you to export your private key, that is not possible. You must transfer your coins directly to your Garlium receive address.</dd>

            <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

            <dl>
                <dt>Garlium is being detected as a virus!</dt>
                <dd>Relax. Garlium is completely safe. Something causes some major AVs to flag Garlium as a trojan, for unknown reasons.</dt>
            
                <dt>Garlium says "Not connected" in the bottom left</dt>
                <dd>The server nodes may be overloaded. Try connecting to another server (under <kbd>Tools -> Network -> Servers</kbd>), restarting Garlium entirely, or just wait a while.</dt>

                <dt>Garlium says "Synchronizing..." in the bottom left for an extended period of time</dt>
                <dd>The server nodes may be overloaded. Try connecting to another server (under <kbd>Tools -> Network -> Servers</kbd>), restarting Garlium entirely, or just wait a while.</dt>

                <dt>Garlium says "Server is lagging (30xxx blocks)"</dt>
                <dd>It's trying to connect to the testnet blockchain, somehow. Delete %AppData%/Garlium/blockchain_headers and restart.</dd>

                <dt>"The program can't start because api-ms-win-crt-stdio-l1-1-0.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem."</dt>
                <dd>Install <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows">this Windows update</a>.</dd>

                <dt>My transactions are too large / require a huge fee!</dt>
                <dt>(or) I get "the transaction was rejected by network rules.\n\n64: dust (or tx-size)" when sending coins</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>If you have a large amount of small incoming transactions in your wallet, your money is split among lots of small transaction inputs. Each input takes up some space in the new transaction, and as such your transaction will become very large. Larger transactions mean larger fees, and at some point the network will downright refuse to process your transaction.</p>
                    <p>To remedy this issue, you must consolidate your inputs. This can be done by going to <kbd>View -> Show Coins</kbd>. Select a number of transactions by dragging (or holding CTRL), right click, and click "Spend". You can then adjust the amount. Either send the coins to your preferred destination address, or to your own Receive address, which will "merge" your inputs into transactions with larger value but smaller blockchain size.</p>
                </dd>
            </dl>

            <hr>
            <p>In fact, deleting %AppData%/Garlium/blockchain_headers and restarting solves a lot of problems. If your issue isn't listed here, perhaps try it?</p>

            <h2>Nodes</h2>
            <p>If you're having connection issues, perhaps connect to another server node. You can add a node by going to <kbd>Tools -> Network -> Servers</kbd>, unchecking "Select server automatically", and inserting the details in the two text boxes.</p>
